# Topstack

Display a (manually managed) list of albums/playlists and play them in Spotify.

Before starting, create your own configuration file in `src/assets/config.json`.
You can use `src/assets/config.json.sample` as a template.

Note: You probably need Spotify Premium to use this program.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
